# Its 2025 Do I really need a website?

The simple answer is yes. Even one as simple as this especially if you want to showcase your knowleddge. A great place to display what you know. A portfolio of sorts. 

# Creating a Website using git hub pages

There are many tutorials already out there I went agead and followed the one from Techno Tim which can be found (here)[https://technotim.live/posts/jekyll-docs-site/].

After followig along to his tutorial you will have a great looking website to use for your documentation or portfolio.
